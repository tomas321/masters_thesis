A list of ideas identified during thesis research and development:
1. alternative network implementation
  - replicate openvswitch network implementation using native linux networking
2. create a preseeded KVM images
  - the original proposal assumes that hosts for k8s nodes are supplied by default
  - an installation procedure with preseeding each node to default desired settings can be used
