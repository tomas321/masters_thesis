Securing a production system in public network against a malicious actor is mostly impossible. The thesis focuses on information security research, specifically on detection of malicious activity in order to gain insights allowing to increase system security. Tools like honeypot, honeynet or sandbox aim to deceive the malicious actors into utilizing available resources to fulfill their agenda. In order to research the activity of sophisticated malicious actors a significant pool of advanced tools and resources must be used. As such, information security researchers should possess the ability to efficiently deceive and motivate malicious actors to carry out their attempt to compromise the system in an isolated, non-production environment. The open-source community already offers technology and tools that can be combined into a solution allowing malicious activity monitoring within an isolated (sandboxed) environment. Analyze tools like honeynet, honeypot and sandbox and identify their applicability into the research problem. Analyze design and implementation aspects of a honeynet system capable of collecting malicious activity-relevant data from the system infiltration until malicious actor's agenda fulfillment. Design appropriate methods, algorithms or processes utilizing found open-source technology for activity monitoring and storage of telemetric data for poossible future analysis. Implement the designed honeynet and verify its applicability in the research area.
