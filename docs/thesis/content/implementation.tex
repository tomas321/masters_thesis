\chapter{Implementation \label{implementation}}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item 
	Manage base setup of Kubernetes nodes via Vagrant.
	\item 
	Deployment of those Vagrant based virtual machines (including networking setup) and Kubernetes (via kubespray \footnote{\url{https://kubespray.io/}}) is done by Ansible.
	\item 
	Kubernetes environments are maintained \footnote{\url{https://github.com/tomas321/k8s-environment-scenarios}} separately.
	\item
	Sneakpeek \footnote{\url{https://github.com/tomas321/sneakpeek}} properly parses the docker container information. It groups nodes with user defined containers created by the Kubernetes orchestration from deployments and pods. Ultimately used for getting the container root FS directory.
	\item
	Fswatch \footnote{\url{https://github.com/tomas321/fswatch}} is a fork with simple improvements and features. It's ran on every acquired container root directory.
	\item
	All is automated with Ansible.

- network traffic is monitored by tapping to the mapped interface on the host system
1. get the docker container pid
2. us nsenter to execute 'ip addr' to get the main net interface
3. from that get the mapped interface 
4. tap on that interface with tcpdump or some other software
